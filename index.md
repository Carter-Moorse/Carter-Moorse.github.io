# Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Carter! I am an easy going, passionate developer based in Cornwall UK, with a strong motivation for problem solving. From a young age, I have always had a keen interest in technology, from building computers to experimenting with code. I have over six years experience in professional software development, which is primarily focused on web-app development; and three years in IT and software higher education. I want to pursue full-stack development, but any technical challenges that come from people, systems or data would spark my interest.

Out of work, I enjoy mountain biking exploring Cornwall and around the country. I am a member of an indoor climbing gym, which I attend bi-weekly. I also play drums in a band.
