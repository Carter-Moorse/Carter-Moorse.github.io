# Hello 👋
My name is Carter. I am a passionate developer based in Cornwall who loves to digest problems and solve them with code. From a young age, I have been surrounded by evolving technology, and questioned “how does that work”. Most of my 6+ years experience is in web-based development. I most enjoy front-end development, working on user interfaces - but I relish technical challenges that come from computers.

In my free time, I like to mountain bike and boulder around my local area. I also play drums in a indie rock band.
